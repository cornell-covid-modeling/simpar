 # Reasoning: the lower bound numbers are the approx winter break
 # occurring NAPs (outside of Cornell testing).
 # In the Ug numbers, it seemed that there were more UG at risk that
 # needed to return rather than NAPs. Normalizing these numbers (~ 5%
 # after all the math), we expect about 2310. I added then an extra bound
 # for some flexibility. Grad populations have much fewer people who need to
 # return, and it seems more NAPs need to return than at risk. I used the
 # UG 5% number to get an upper bound instead of an estimate of the center.
 # I could do this analysis a little more fine grained for UG off vs on campus
 # but I don't think it affects things much.

# In the modeling team's spring 2021 projections, based on fall 2020 data, we estimated per-person
# outside infection rates of 1.42E-5 for the greek/athlete population, 7.11E-6 for other UG, and
# 6.45E-6 for graduate students.  During this period, we estimated 1.209 E-4 for faculty and staff.
# This puts the most social student population at about 1/10 of the employee rate per-person.
# Let's use this same rule of thumb for spring 2022, setting the student meta-groups to 1/10 of the
# employee per-person rate. With faculty and staff at 5 per day, this gives:
# - a UG number of 5*(16K/10K)/10 = 0.8
# - a GR number of 5*(8K/10K)/10 = 0.4
# - a PR number of 5*(3K/10K)/10 = 0.15
