simpar simulates a pandemic's spread through a population using an SIR model.
It provides the ability to manage a heterogeneous population with varying
contact levels. The tool focuses on providing functionality for assessing
various pandemic response strategies such as isolation protocols, testing
regimes (with varying tests), and vaccination requirements.
