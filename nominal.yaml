# In the modeling team's spring 2021 projections, based on fall 2020 data, we estimated per-person
# outside infection rates of 1.42E-5 for the greek/athlete population, 7.11E-6 for other UG, and
# 6.45E-6 for graduate students.  During this period, we estimated 1.209 E-4 for faculty and staff.
# This puts the most social student population at about 1/10 of the employee rate per-person.
# Let's use this same rule of thumb for spring 2022, setting the student meta-groups to 1/10 of the
# employee per-person rate. With faculty and staff at 5 per day, this gives:
# - a UG number of 5*(16K/10K)/10 = 0.8
# - a GR number of 5*(8K/10K)/10 = 0.4
# - a PR number of 5*(3K/10K)/10 = 0.15
