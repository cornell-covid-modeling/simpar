# Fraction of positive people that would be discovered as positive in the absence of regular required testing, shortly after their infection.
# As discussed in the spring 2022 modeling report in the "Probability of Detection without Regular Required Testing",
# we use a range of 22% to 56%, treating this as a 95% confidence interval for this parameter.
# This gives a mean of 0.39 and a standard deviation of .09.
# In the early-Jan nominal scenario, this parameter was estimated to be .525. This was based on
# an estimate of 35% as reporting symptoms, and then multiplying by 1.5 to account for contact tracing.
